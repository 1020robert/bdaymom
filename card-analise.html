      <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
      <p>I wanted to wish you a very, very happy birthday. I know everyone says this, but we truly do have the best mom in the whole world. 
        From a young age, you’ve always had a gift for turning everything into a fun, positive experience—whether it was teaching me clever 
        little tricks to learn vocabulary words or putting your heart into every holiday and making it so special for each and every one of us. 
        You’ve always made each day special. Speaking for myself and my siblings, we are so incredibly lucky to have you as our mom. You are always 
        there for us. I feel so fortunate to have a mom I can tell everything to. You listen with love, make me feel heard, and every time I talk to you, 
        I feel supported. When my friends would ask, “Why do you tell your mom everything?” the answer was always simple—because talking to you has always 
        been a judgment-free zone. I admire you more than you could ever imagine—from the way you raised us and care for us, to the love you give Grandma, 
        to the amazing doggy mommy you were to Bruno, and the care and compassion you show the kids at Hannah’s Home. Your love really does touch everyone 
        and it’s truly inspiring. When I was little, I would dress up like you and say, “I want to be you.” And that’s still true. I hope to grow up and 
        make the people around me feel as loved and supported as you make us feel every single day. Once again, I hope you have the best birthday ever. 
        I wish I could be there to celebrate with you today, but I can’t wait for you to visit this summer!</p>
