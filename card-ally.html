      <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
      <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM! How lucky am I to get to call you my mom? I can imagine being five people’s emergency contact isn’t easy, 
        but you are such a natural. There aren’t many people in the world who are truly meant to be a mom, but you are—everything about 
        you is kind, caring, patient, and nurturing. I feel incredibly lucky to learn from you as I’ve gotten older and to always have your 
        guidance and perspective in everything I do. As Dan says, “Ally, you can’t decide until you call your mom,” so I just call you—you’re 
        the best sounding board, mom, and friend. Words can’t fully describe how much you mean to me and how much I love you! Thank you for 
        everything you do and are, because you’re oh so wonderful. I’d be lucky to be even half the mom you are one day (I’m trying with Blue 
        first, haha). Have the best day, and I wish I could be there to give you the biggest hug. You’re the absolute best, and I love you so, so much!</p>
      <p class="signature">Love,<br>Ally</p>
