      <h1>Dear Mom,</h1>
      <p>Happy Happy Birthday!!! I hope you have/had the most amazing day celebrating with Dad and RJ, and we'll have to do a belated celebration 
        when I see you soon in LBI. You deserve to be celebrated every day though! Something that is really special about having you as a mom is 
        that all five of us (Bruno too) have always felt celebrated throughout our entire lives. You have always been our loudest cheerleader, and 
        we could not be luckier to have you. I remember once when I was a kid, we were in the car together and you told me a story about how your 
        dad used to make it sound like he was dodging through traffic to get to your school concerts (or something like that), and that he always 
        had the loudest claps in the room. You were talking about how special it made you feel—and you have made all of us feel that way for our 
        whole lives! Thanks for being the best mom ever at every age. I love you so much and cheers to another year!!</p>
