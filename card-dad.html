      <h1>Dear Sue,</h1>
      <p>Happy Birthday to the most beautiful person inside and out in the universe. You aren’t just top one percent for your hair—you 
        are the top one percent for everything that matters most in life. 💕💕💕💕 I love you so much and love how you have been so dedicated 
        to your volunteer work and your family. The kids and parents at Hannah’s Home are so fortunate to have you, and we are all lucky to 
        have you. We hit the jackpot with you. 💕💕💕💕 You are an inspiration to all of us. I love your easy smile and wonderful sense of humor. 
        You’ve taught me to laugh and smile more often, and not to take myself too seriously. I love you, and you look amazing. I admire your 
        regular workouts and commitment to your health. 💕💕💕💕😘😘😘😘 Happy birthday, my love. ❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>
      <p class="signature">Love,<br>Dad</p>
